        <h1>Why I want to become a developer? </h1>
        <p>Software Development Is High in Demand 
            Creating software is not an easy task. It entails various activities, including developing scripts, testing the final product, debugging errors, and ensuring client satisfaction, among others. In this day and age, finding a job that requires intelligent folks to spend time writing software according to specifications is challenging.
            
            This is why software developers are pretty rare in the tech industry. Even though it is a well-paid profession, not everyone possesses the necessary competence, which is why you, after lots of practice and training, should become one and reap the benefits.
            
            Problem-Solving Abilities Are Abundant Among Software Developers
            Do you have an uncanny ability to solve even the most challenging problems? Then software development is something you should absolutely try.            
            Why?
	        Software development is hours of writing and executing codes, debugging, and solving the erupted errors. Employers are also looking for employees who can develop innovative solutions to existing problems.
            There Is No Shortage of Opportunities to Learn
            Working in the tech industry means you must constantly learn new things. New programming languages, innovations, and features regularly emerge in the tech sector. As a result, those who work in such an ever-evolving industry are always learning. 
            Software engineers may always learn something new and stay ahead of the curve in terms of technical expertise.
            
            Great Compensation
            The high pay is another appealing argument to work as a software developer. Software developers are in high demand and earn incredible salaries from entry-level up. And the amount increases with experience and successful projects.
            
            Teamwork is dreamwork
            Software development isn’t a solitary activity. Instead, a team of highly skilled developers is necessary to construct a successful business model.
            
            As a software developer, you will be part of an equally enthusiastic team. As a result, you’ll make more connections and have a better chance of starting your own business.
            
            Software Development Is the Ideal Job for Creative Individuals.
            Do you have an IDEA? You can create unique software with just that idea, no matter how innovative or challenging it is. One of the perks of working as a software developer is the ability to do so.
            
            As you’d be taught every nook and cranny of development, you’ll have a better understanding of how the computer world works and be able to pitch your ideas for creating software that will help others.

            Software Developers Can Work Remotely
            The days of getting up and walking to work are long gone. Most people can now work entirely on computers. Thus, employees are no longer required to report to the office.
            
            Software developers whose entire job relies on typing codes on the desktop can work remotely to do their job. 
            
            Numerous software programs can help you expedite your responsibilities, such as video conferencing, project management, and workspaces. So, if you want to work from the comfort of your own home, software development is the appropriate choice for you.
            
            Software Development Offers Diverse Career Options
            Most people believe that software development is just another IT job that demands someone to sit in the same place for hours and type unreadable code.
            
            That is the truth, but that is not their only job.
            
            Other than IT, software developers have a variety of job options. For example, Healthcare, retail, and various other well-known niche industries demand a significant number of qualified software development employees to enhance their brand.</p>
